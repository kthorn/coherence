// commands.ts — THE COMMAND REGISTRY: which verbs `coherence` has, declared ONCE.
//
// This file exists because the command list was spelled in three places and enforced in
// none, and in two days it drifted three times:
//   · the usage banner produced v0.14.0's ONLY merge conflict — two branches hand-edited
//     the same `<a|b|c>` string literal.
//   · banner vs dispatch measured 29 vs 30.
//   · README's `## Commands` vs dispatch measured 20 vs 32 — twelve commands undocumented,
//     including `dismiss` listed while its six sibling journal verbs were not, so a reader
//     found a verb for retiring conjectures with nothing explaining what a conjecture is.
// `coherence redundancy` flagged the banner/dispatch pair every run as "identical today,
// tied together by nothing". This is the harness's own convention-tier finding, and the
// fix it recommends is the one applied here: DERIVE ONE SPELLING FROM THE OTHER.
//
// WHY A REGISTRY AND NOT A HANDLER TABLE. The strongest form would delete the
// correspondence outright — a `Record<name, handler>` and no if/else chain at all. That
// refactor was rejected for now: cli.ts's dispatch is 350 lines of early exits, shared
// locals and per-command usage errors, and rewriting it to land a documentation fix trades
// a checked correspondence for an unchecked rewrite. What is here instead: one declarative
// home, two DERIVED spellings (the banner, the README index), and a totality oracle that
// enumerates the LIVE dispatch out of cli.ts's AST and asserts the two sets are equal
// (test/commands.test.ts). The dispatch is still hand-written; it can no longer disagree.
//
// WHY THIS FILE AND NOT cli.ts. cli.ts executes at import: `process.argv[2]`, the if/else
// chain and `process.exit` all run at module scope. A test cannot import it. A source of
// truth its own oracle cannot read is not one.
//
// NO TIMESTAMP IN THE RENDERED BLOCK, on purpose. The block is a pure function of this
// array — no clock, no absolute path, nothing machine-specific — so `docs --check` compares
// it byte-for-byte with zero normalization. Every normalization a freshness gate needs is a
// hole in that gate (see cli.ts's `normGraphHtml`, which has three).

   *  baseline, at both `--check` and `--update-baseline`. That second oracle is the point.
   *  A flag that is merely declared protects nothing; what protects the next ratchet is
   *  that the day it is registered, the suite demands the refusal from it too.

   *  ONE predicate read from the graph (`vacuityRefusal`, applied in cli.ts before the

   *  receives a graph at all, it reads `scanSources`. Each ratchet supplies its own

   *
   *  This question was left OPEN in the journal when `writesArtifacts` landed ("whether a
   *  broken deriver should also be barred from zeroing a baseline is a real and separate
