# Harness core

Builds the source/spec graph, evaluates declared claims, renders reading surfaces, and
records the decisions and observations that must survive an agent's context window.

The CLI is deliberately a thin composition root. Parsing, derivation, verification,
rendering, and journaling remain independently addressable modules beneath this boundary.

## refutations

- session startup survives a damaged decision-journal path with named degradation: with `.coherence/decisions` replaced by a regular file, SessionStart threw raw `ENOTDIR` before emitting any instructions. It now retains the exact host session, names `JOURNAL CONTROL unavailable`, performs no journal write, and exits zero.
- session startup teaches the executable swarm loop without manufacturing authority: after the work graph, orientation, and consequence ledger shipped, canonical startup still taught only the decision journal and experiment planning; an exact assignment printed `work inspect` but no safe way to accept, block, hand off, or close it. Startup now names the read-only heading and fleet reads for everyone, reserves create/handoff for explicit coordination authority, and emits state-valid lifecycle commands with the standing predecessor only beside work owned by that exact session.
- hook telemetry loss never kills PostToolUse: the original no-dependency canary sent `{}`, producing no read event and never exercising persistence. A real Read event with `.coherence/read-traces` replaced by a regular file threw `EEXIST` out of the hook. The runtime boundary now contains telemetry failure, stays byte-silent, and the canary carries the hostile target.
- orientation admits verification state only with valid shape and comparable provenance: a parseable status row with `at: "not-a-time"` and `failures: "not-a-number"` was reported as current and allowed `STEADY`; missing commit provenance on either side was also treated as agreement. Runtime shape, canonical time, count, tier, and commit checks now refuse malformed evidence, while absent provenance remains stale.
- swarm write identity and authority flags are singleton or refused: `work create ... --session one --session two` succeeded and silently attributed the append to `two`; the same last-wins ambiguity existed for authority and consequence writers. The shared CLI check now refuses every non-repeatable flag before any append.
- work state is append-only, attributable, and predecessor-checked: the first live four-agent field run replayed correctly in its originating worktree, but `.coherence/work/` still matched the repository's blanket ignore, so a fresh clone would lose every order, handoff, and closure. The repository guard now writes through the public CLI, commits under the live ignore policy, clones, and strictly replays the work instead of accepting that locally-correct but non-durable state.
- authored work text is single-line data, never model-instruction control: a work objective containing a newline and `SYSTEM:` was accepted and interpolated into SessionStart as a peer instruction. Work writers now reject C0/C1 controls, while hook rendering escapes them defensively at the instruction boundary.
- specialized consequence relations admit only their declared endpoint kinds: `work:a --produces--> decision:d` and `commit:a --produces--> work:b` were accepted even though the documented lifecycle defines production as work-to-commit. Endpoint validation now makes that relation exact rather than merely checking its source kind.
- a terminal parent has no live child and explicitly synthesizes every completed direct child: a parent could close with `synthesizedChildren: []` after a child completed, leaving an irreparable synthesis heading because terminal work cannot close again; a child created after parent closure remained dispatch-ready even though its join target was dead. Prospective graph validation now refuses both transitions before append.
- work cannot activate or complete before every dependency completes: readiness was projection-only, so a waiting work item could transition to active and then completed while its dependency stayed open; orientation accepted the impossible ordering. Every lifecycle write now validates the prospective graph and refuses that dependency-order violation.
- verdict-bearing decision reads fail closed on surviving journal damage: a symlinked `.coherence` could supply external valid rows, a renamed or blank/torn file silently shrank the trusted population, and case-distinct `Owner`/`owner` sessions collided on case-folding filesystems. The trusted projection now validates containment, every directory entry, append framing, and domain-separated hashed session addresses before admitting any row.
- a committed decision population cannot disappear into adoption from zero: two valid conflicting decision files produced `RESOLVE-CONFLICT`; deleting the entire tracked directory then produced zero trusted rows and `STEADY`. The strict empty projection now asks current Git `HEAD` whether tracked decision files disappeared, while a repository that never owned a ledger remains valid first-use adoption.
- verification currency follows material repository state without invalidating its own receipt: a clean full status at `HEAD` remained `CURRENT` and allowed `STEADY` after a tracked source changed because orientation compared only commits. Live Git dirtiness now invalidates currency while excluding exactly `.coherence/status.json`, the receipt written after provenance was sampled.
- orientation selects synthesis only when parent closure can execute it: with parent work active, child A completed, and dependency-clear child B ready, orientation selected `SYNTHESIZE`; the only synthesis operation is parent closure, which correctly refused while B was live, so obeying the heading could not advance. Pending results now select synthesis only after that parent's children are terminal; otherwise the live sibling receives `DISPATCH`, `CONTINUE`, or `UNBLOCK`.
- orientation derives live blockage only from closeable work state: the first real-worktree `orient` canary emitted `UNBLOCK` with zero work orders because it counted 23 historical journal `blocked` reports. Those rows have no completion event, so the heading could never converge. They remain visible as historical evidence while only the append-only work lifecycle can select a live unblock action.
- consequence evidence refuses surviving storage damage instead of shrinking navigation: the first strict reader inspected only the final ledger directory, filtered for `*.jsonl`, and accepted a complete last row without its append newline. A symlinked `.coherence` parent could therefore redirect the read, renaming a surviving session file to `.bak` made the graph look clean and empty, and case-distinct sessions collided on case-folding filesystems. The reader now validates both directory components, every surviving entry, canonical append framing, and domain-separated hashed session addresses before admitting any edge.
- consequence navigation contains only explicit assessed edges: the live blind-handoff trial reconstructed the mission from explicit edges, but `.coherence/consequences/` was ignored, making that successful navigation disappear on clone. The same repository guard now commits a typed edge to a real Git endpoint, clones it, and requires both strict replay and a dangling-free orientation.
- harness source remains searchable text rather than silently becoming binary: two new render/validation regexes carried literal NUL bytes, and `rg` classified `src/consequence.ts` as binary instead of returning navigable source matches. The ranges now use escaped source notation and the focused guard enumerates every live TypeScript source, so the same byte turns the claim red rather than degrading repository navigation silently.
- high-frequency lifecycle hooks start without the analysis dependency stack: the live PostToolUse hook failed before reading its event with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `web-tree-sitter`; the eager chain was `hook-cli → hooks → due → commands → phrasebook → oracle-domain → web-tree-sitter`. `npm ci` repaired the checkout but left the failure class intact. Moving executable phrasebook data injection to the CLI composition root dissolved the eager edge, and the isolated no-`node_modules` runtime canary now passes.
- fast verification rejects a statically vanished Vitest oracle without executing tests: changed `resolveStaticOracle`'s complete zero-match branch from `absent` to `unknown` (2026-08-20), laundering the motivating Mnemion rename into an ordinary fast-tier skip — the focused boundary guard failed and captured the dangerous verdict: `claims: 1 · 0 green · 0 red · 1 skipped`, followed by `✓ coherent`. Restored; the same fixture now reds `VANISHED ORACLE (static)` without Vitest installed or invoked.
- fast verification rejects a statically vanished Vitest oracle without executing tests: 0.36.2 made incompleteness project-wide, so Mnemion's finite data-driven titles made an unrelated renamed clipboard oracle UNKNOWN forever. Reproduced against current main: renaming the literal clipboard test left fast verify green. The scanner now retains concrete runner names and owner paths from Git `HEAD`; losing a name from a deleted or still-complete former owner reds before unrelated current uncertainty is consulted, while a former owner that itself became dynamic remains UNKNOWN. No prefix guess or partial JavaScript evaluator is allowed to manufacture global completeness.
- fast oracle absence requires a complete direct-declaration population: before release, conventional files whose tests came only from a bare side-effect import, top-level `import()`, or `require()` each produced `fullNames=[]`, `incomplete=[]`, and `absent`, so fast verification could call a live runtime-owned oracle vanished. Release audit then found the same false absence behind a transitive local Vitest alias and a live `build/live.test.ts`, while a conventional file symlink was followed outside the declared traversal boundary. The scanner now resolves exact alias chains, marks registration-time module loads incomplete, mirrors Vitest v4's `node_modules`/`.git` default exclusions, and refuses every symlink/custom collection surface into UNKNOWN; loads inside test callbacks remain ordinary subject execution.
- committed platform capabilities survive optional deployment-config toggles: Mnemion intentionally ships its `DOCUMENTS` R2 stanza commented so clean deploys need no R2 account, while three committed `Env` interfaces declare `DOCUMENTS?: R2Bucket`. A graph made with a locally enabled stanza gained `i:DOCUMENTS` and its bind edges; the same commit in a clean clone lost them and failed docs freshness. The Cloudflare adapter now unions direct typed `Env` capabilities from the already-filtered code population with wrangler declarations, deduplicates agreement, and refuses type conflicts; a generated local declaration cannot re-enter after the project ignores it.
- committed platform capabilities survive optional deployment-config toggles: after 0.36.3 stabilized Mnemion's nodes and edges, `bindings.vars.WORKER_HOST` still embedded the working-tree Wrangler value verbatim (`your-worker.workers.dev` in Git, the real host on the deploy machine), so docs freshness still failed on one line. Reproduced against current Mnemion main: changing only that value changed the old graph. `Bindings.vars` can now represent only the literal marker `declared`; pristine and real-host variants produce the same normalized graph hash while the `WORKER_HOST` name remains visible.
- a parse's heap is returned before the next file: shipped 0.34.0 with no `tree.delete()` at any parse site — an adopter's configless `verify` from a home directory aborted the wasm runtime mid-walk (`RuntimeError: Aborted()` in Parser.parse). Reproduced at exactly parse #638 of an 80KB file; the identical loop with delete runs unbounded. The oracle-gate agent had already observed the failure mode in its harness and it was read as gate plumbing rather than a shipped hazard. Fixed by dissolution: every parse routes through `withTree`, which frees in a finally, so the leak is unrepresentable — and the guard is calibrated just past the measured cliff.

- surviving agent-assessed defect evidence is attributable and internally consistent: disabled the content-address recomputation in the strict reader (2026-08-20), so a summary, evidence string, or timestamp changed without its id remained readable — full verify red this claim by name at `claims: 51 · 50 green · 1 red`; the guard observed that the inconsistent row no longer refused. Restored. This detects accidental or partial damage, not an adversary who rewrites a valid row and recomputes its unkeyed id; committed Git history is that rewrite witness.
- defect writes refuse pre-existing symlink redirection: before release, replaced `.coherence/defects` with a symlink to an outside temporary directory and `recordDefect` created the session ledger there; replacing a session target with an outside-file symlink likewise appended through it. The focused containment guard now refuses both, and the writer opens the final component with `O_NOFOLLOW` plus descriptor/path identity checks. This is a stable-filesystem guarantee, not a claim to defeat a privileged concurrent parent-directory rename.
- defect provenance is data, never terminal control: before release, replaced a valid row's commit with `deadbeef` plus an ESC clear-screen sequence, recomputed its ordinary content id, and the strict reader accepted it; the human render contained the live control byte. The focused provenance guard now requires lowercase 40- or 64-hex Git object-name shape, and rendering still escapes it defensively.
- a weaker regulation obligation never masks a stronger one: swapped `candidateCompare` from potential-first to doctrine-rule-first (2026-08-04), so the earlier lifecycle-control redirect masked the stronger current-patch decision when both were owed — full verify red by name, alongside the independent Stop mutation, at `claims: 32 · 30 green · 2 red`; the guard observed `redirect` where `require-decision` was required. Restored. This is the dangerous direction: a stable ordering that is stable on the wrong axis still makes the controller converge on lower-value work.
- agent lifecycle preserves decisions and exposes the current change signal: inserted an `emit` immediately after main Stop's calibration snapshot (2026-08-04), recreating the conclusion-echo failure and the deeper attribution error — shared-worktree state bought whichever main agent happened to stop another model turn. Full verify red this claim by name at `claims: 32 · 31 green · 1 red`; the runtime guard observed nonempty stdout even for the quiet main Stop. Restored. SubagentStop still restates because its parent may see only the final reply; main Stop now snapshots calibration with byte-empty stdout.
- lifecycle hook presence is one canonical runnable bit: loosened `inspectLifecycleHook` so `present` ignored `wiringPresent` and trusted only valid JSON plus the launcher (2026-08-03) — full verify named this claim as the sole red, `claims: 30 · 29 green · 1 red`; the guard's duplicate-canonical-group fixture observed the laundered `true`. Restored. This is the dangerous direction: a checker that accepts two firing paths is not a binary control, only a substring detector with a nicer report.
- pinned mass follows a value-conserving rename but never absorbs growth: mutated `reconcileMass` in BOTH directions (2026-07-31) and full verify reds the claim by name each time. (a) `const hit = undefined` — the pre-fix behaviour where a rename never absorbs: `claims: 27 · 26 green · 1 red`, the H1-rename phase failing on strictEqual (a one-line spec rename read as growth again). (b) dropped the VALUE from the move-invariant address so any same-family vanished pin absorbs any new name — the laundering direction: same `27 · 26 green · 1 red`, the renamed-AND-grown phase failing on match (the growth rode in under the rename and the guard caught the missing NEW-dimension report). Restored, back to 27/27. As with the sinks reconciler, (b) is the direction that matters: a rename-forgiver that cannot fail is a growth ratchet that deleted itself.
- reviewed risk sites survive relocation but never duplication: mutated `reconcile` in BOTH directions and the guard reds each time. (a) `const from = undefined` — the pre-fix behaviour where the path is part of a site's identity: `claims: 23 · 22 green · 1 red`, the moved file reported as new risk. (b) absorb from every baselined address instead of only vanished ones, without consuming the pool — plain content-addressing: same `1 red`, the copied sink waved through. Restored, back to 23/23. The loosening direction is the one that matters: a fix for a false alarm that cannot fail (b) is a fix that deleted the ratchet.
- cached decisions expose structurally expired premises: gutted `auditPremiseLeases` to return `{entries: [], expired: [], checked: 0}` unconditionally — the SAME mutation that left the tree "✓ coherent" while the claim carried no oracle. With the guard wired it reds by name: `claims: 22 · 21 green · 1 red`, `✗ 1 coherence failure(s)`. Restored, back to 22/22. The other four claims now execute (137ms, 135ms and siblings in the holding-cost block) but have not yet been individually mutated — that is the next increment, not a claim made here.
- predicted context closure is calibrated against observed reads and outcomes: hardcoded `calibrationStats`' defect count to `defects: 0` (audit M1, re-run 2026-07-31) -> full verify RED by name, `claims: 23 · 22 green · 1 red`, the calibration guard failing on strictEqual. Restored, back to green.
- significant behavioral growth acquires an anchor or patch-specific decision: made `signalState` return `"attested"` for an unattested zero-anchor alarm (audit M2, re-run 2026-07-31) -> full verify RED by name, `claims: 23 · 22 green · 1 red`, the zero-anchor guard failing. Restored, back to green. The SAME mutation left `verify --fast` "✓ coherent" and `npm test` 589-pass when the guard's test was merely RETITLED (audit M4) — which is why CI now runs the full tier.
- a claim goes green only on positive evidence its oracle ran: deleted the testMatch evidence rule from the serial arm — the audit-M3 mutation that previously left the tree 23/23 "✓ coherent" with the anti-vacuity mechanism gone -> now `claims: 26 · 25 green · 1 red`, this claim red by name. Restored, 26/26.
- a vanished oracle reds its claim, never green-by-absence: made zero batch matches return `ok: true` -> `claims: 26 · 25 green · 1 red`, this claim red by name. Restored, 26/26.
- a declared invariant unanchored by any boundary fails coverage: wrapped the gap-collection loop in `if (false)` -> `claims: 26 · 25 green · 1 red`, this claim red by name. Restored, 26/26.
- a via-test oracle that iterates no live domain fails its claim: flipped the self-literal domain branch to report `live` -> `claims: 26 · 25 green · 1 red`, this claim red by name. Restored, 26/26.
- a skipped run never clobbers an oracle's recorded verdict: made the merge take the fresh skip unconditionally -> `claims: 26 · 25 green · 1 red`, this claim red by name. Restored, 26/26.
- a named oracle that no test runs cannot pass: made the no-owning-file branch exit 0 -> `claims: 26 · 25 green · 1 red`, this claim red by name (the guard test, run by the mutated runner itself, observed the quiet pass). Restored, 26/26.
- a streamed journal entry renders exactly once across appends and compaction: deleted the `seen` dedupe from `tailJournal`'s parse loop — every parsed line pushed unconditionally, so a compaction fold replays its whole record set (2026-08-04) — full verify red BY NAME, `claims: 31 · 30 green · 1 red`, this claim failing through its guard (the fold fixture observed the replay). Restored, back to 31/31. This is the loosening direction and the quiet one: a feed that duplicates does not crash, it just teaches the orchestrator that a question was decided twice — the exact lie the content address exists to prevent.
- an empty derivation against a remembered surface refuses, never passes: mutated BOTH ends (2026-07-31). (a) gutted `buildGraph` to return an empty graph — the original defect, which before the floor printed `claims: 0 · 0 green · 0 red · 0 skipped` and `✓ coherent`, exit 0: now full verify refuses before grading (`✗ [floor] the derived graph is EMPTY of claims — 0 component(s), 0 claims — but the record remembers 27 claim(s)`), exit 1, on the scoped path too, and the record is left un-clobbered so the refusal repeats. (b) made `vacuityRefusal` return null unconditionally — the floor itself deleted: full verify red BY NAME, `claims: 28 · 27 green · 1 red`, this claim failing through its guard. Restored, 28/28. (b) is the direction that matters: a floor that cannot fail is the vacuity it exists to catch.

## why

**a scoped batch receives selected component directories while a full batch clears inherited scope.** Selection belongs to the verifier, not a second Git-diff implementation in every runner. The environment handoff lets a repository adapter avoid unrelated oracles without changing arbitrary batch-command arguments. Explicitly clearing inherited scope prevents a nested full verification from accidentally narrowing its evidence. The subprocess regression crosses the actual environment boundary; report matching still independently decides every verdict.

Journaling guidance treats durable memory as optional and follows repository policy rather than duplicating tests, issues, and PR evidence. No-entry sessions are legitimate. This is an agent-facing instruction contract reviewed as prose, not a claim that an oracle can prove a model's compliance. Existing history, manual journal operations, exact coordination authority, and lifecycle telemetry are unchanged.

**agent lifecycle preserves decisions and exposes the current change signal.** Decisions
and risk are cheapest to surface while the agent still holds the context that produced
them; waiting for a later reviewer externalizes both reconstruction costs. The two stop
surfaces are not interchangeable: a subagent restates its report because its caller may
see nothing else, while the main agent has already shown its report to the user and is
never interrupted by shared-worktree state that may belong to another agent. Main Stop
keeps the calibration observation and emits no bytes; only SubagentStop carries the
journal and patch signal forward.

**significant behavioral growth acquires an anchor or patch-specific decision.** The cost
of adding an invariant is immediate while the cost of omitting it appears later, so the
current patch must carry either enforcement or an addressable reason that it needs none.

**native Pi lifecycle preserves host meaning without requiring pi-subagents.** Pi's
in-process extension maps exact native session, tool, and settlement events, remains
useful with no child package, and allows one guarded child completion turn when
`PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD=1`; native transport stays distinct from Claude/Codex launchers.

**lifecycle persistence respects protected checkout ownership across every supported host.**
A host event arrives before an agent can obey repository prose, so textual worktree guidance
cannot authorize automatic persistence. When the project opts in, Git's registered primary
worktree remains read-only across explicit CLI operations and Claude, Codex, and Pi lifecycle
events; an unprovable identity refuses writes rather than becoming permission. Linked
worktrees retain the complete evidence path.

**a weaker regulation obligation never masks a stronger one.** Regulation compares live
obligations by a lexicographic potential, with missing observations failing closed instead
of becoming zero, and returns the single strongest action owed. V2 evaluates only rules
declared in the live doctrine registry; even a no-action result makes no claim of overall
safety.

**regulation evaluates and repairs the selected agent host.** A canonical Claude control
cannot create a field around a Codex session, even though both hosts implement the same
lifecycle domain. The sensor therefore names the explicit or current host in its reading,
the decision identity retains it, and a lifecycle redirect installs that same host. A
foreign host value refuses before it can release or author a shell command.

**task context is bounded and names its approximations.** A focused context packet is
useful only when its one-hop and heuristic limits stay visible; otherwise convenience is
misread as completeness and recreates the omission gradient this project exists to oppose.
Routes, named limitations, and omission accounting are mandatory framing; a byte budget
that cannot hold them refuses with its exact minimum. Everything else is included in a
stable priority order, and the withheld item and byte totals make truncation observable.
Repository-level, generated, and explicitly requested ignored files remain navigable even
when the source graph owns no component for them; `graphOwner: null` is evidence, not a miss.

**verdict-bearing decision reads fail closed on surviving journal damage.** The journal's
tolerant reader is useful for a human salvaging old history, but a regulator or waiver
cannot turn its skipped lines into a smaller trusted population. The strict projection
validates wire version, canonical shape and time, content identity, session/file
attribution, containment, append framing, duplicate agreement, and terminal references
as one relation. Domain-separated session hashes retain case-sensitive identity on
case-folding filesystems while an owned historical filename remains readable. Any damage
makes the verdict-bearing population unavailable while the historical render stays
backward-compatible.

**a committed decision population cannot disappear into adoption from zero.** An absent
ledger is legitimate before first use, so filesystem absence alone proves nothing. Once
current Git `HEAD` owns decision files, however, their wholesale deletion is an external
witness that zero rows means lost evidence rather than adoption. The witness is consulted
only at zero: populated compaction remains legal, while non-Git and unborn repositories
retain an honestly unproven empty state.

**decision ratification follows explicit subject and authority, never prose similarity or
recency.** Independent agents can word the same question differently and can mention the
same noun while answering different questions. Conflict detection therefore compares only
standing decisions that share a machine-authored subject. Local alternatives remain
proposals; one explicit orchestrator-accepted or user-directed choice can ratify them;
incompatible choices tied at the highest authority stay contested.

**work state is append-only, attributable, and predecessor-checked.** A shared task board
that mutates in place loses the handoffs and rejected transitions a swarm most needs after
context loss. Each work order and transition is content-addressed in its writer session,
and the current state is a strict replay. Broken predecessors, competing successors,
detached histories, damaged rows, and missing graph referents refuse instead of resolving
by last-write-wins. The ledger is repository evidence rather than a machine-local queue;
the repository control therefore writes one through the public boundary, commits it,
clones the repository, and requires the strict reader to reconstruct it.

**work cannot activate or complete before every dependency completes.** Readiness is not
advice layered over the lifecycle; it is the lifecycle's ordering law. Every transition
and closure validates its prospective graph before append, so a caller cannot bypass a
waiting projection by naming `active` or `completed` directly. Cancellation remains a
terminal non-success and therefore does not satisfy a dependency that requires completed
output.

**runnable work with overlapping write scopes is a collision, never concurrent
permission.** Read and write scopes are repository-relative addresses. Dependency order
can make an overlap merely potential, but two dependency-clear or active writers whose
exact/tree scopes intersect are a live conflict. The projection blocks dispatch and names
both work ids and both scopes; ownership is explicit rather than reverse-engineered from a
shared diff.

**a terminal parent has no live child and explicitly synthesizes every completed direct
child.** A child returning is not evidence that its parent incorporated the result, and a
live child whose join target is closed has nowhere truthful to report. Prospective graph
validation therefore refuses parent closure until every direct child is terminal, requires
every completed child in the synthesis set, and refuses a late live child beneath a
terminal parent. Cancellation can settle a child but cannot masquerade as synthesized
success.

**authored work text is single-line data, never model-instruction control.** Work records
are repository-authored evidence on read, even when they were valid on write. Their text
crosses into SessionStart's model-instruction channel, so public writes reject C0/C1
controls and the hook renderer escapes such bytes again. A newline can remain visible as
data but cannot acquire the grammar of a peer instruction.

**swarm write identity and authority flags are singleton or refused.** Repeated evidence,
criteria, alternatives, and scopes represent honest plurality; repeated session, owner,
authority, or predecessor selectors represent two incompatible attributions for one
append. One shared parser predicate distinguishes those sets and refuses ambiguity before
any ledger writer runs.

**consequence navigation contains only explicit assessed edges.** Decisions, work,
commits, experiments, verification, and defects already have addresses; temporal or path
proximity does not make one cause another. The consequence ledger stores an assessor,
evidence, typed endpoints, and a constrained relation per edge. Its graph traverses both
directions for navigation while retaining the authored direction, and strict reads refuse
forged, displaced, conflicting, or symlink-redirected evidence. Those edges are durable
only if they cross a clone boundary, so the repository control writes a typed edge to a
real commit, transports it through Git, and requires a dangling-free cloned orientation.

**specialized consequence relations admit only their declared endpoint kinds.** A generic
`relates-to` edge can connect any two supported addresses, but verbs such as `produces`,
`verifies`, `reveals`, and `repairs` carry lifecycle meaning. Their source and target kinds
are checked as a pair, keeping the typed graph from accepting grammatically valid nonsense
that its render would otherwise state with unwarranted confidence.

**consequence evidence refuses surviving storage damage instead of shrinking navigation.**
Absence is a legitimate first-use state; a surviving but unreadable, displaced, renamed,
or torn edge is not. If damaged bytes could disappear from the population, removing one
file suffix or final newline could erase the only path from a defect to its repair while
leaving an innocent empty graph. Storage framing and containment therefore belong to the
evidence contract, not merely to filesystem hygiene.

**orientation refuses damaged evidence before selecting a swarm heading.** The gyroscope
is a projection over independent instruments, not a new source of truth. It reads each
strictly, preserves source availability and denominators, and selects one deterministic
heading: refuse, resolve a collision, repair navigation, unblock, synthesize, dispatch,
continue, verify, or steady. A damaged source outranks every actionable-looking empty list.

**orientation admits verification state only with valid shape and comparable provenance.**
The status file is persisted JSON, not a TypeScript value at runtime. Orientation validates
the fields it uses—canonical time, commit shape, dirty bit, tier, and nonnegative failure
count—and refuses malformed evidence. A green report is current only when both repository
and report commit addresses exist and agree; missing provenance is stale, never an
implicit match.

**verification currency follows material repository state without invalidating its own
receipt.** Matching `HEAD` identifies a commit, not the live index and working tree layered
over it. A source, staged, or untracked change therefore makes a clean report stale even
when `HEAD` did not move. The status file itself is the one excluded path because recording
the report happens after its Git sample; counting that receipt would make every successful
verification invalidate itself immediately.

**orientation selects synthesis only when parent closure can execute it.** Synthesis is
represented by the parent's terminal close, not by a separate mutable checkbox. A completed
child can therefore remain visibly unsynthesized while a ready, active, or blocked sibling
still owes work; selecting synthesis then would demand an operation the lifecycle refuses.
Only when that parent's children are terminal does synthesis become the executable highest
heading.

**orientation derives live blockage only from closeable work state.** A journaled impasse
is historical testimony and has no event that later marks it complete. Treating such rows
as the live scheduler makes the heading demand an action the record cannot ever discharge.
The work lifecycle owns current blocked state; journal incidents remain visible context
without acquiring scheduler semantics.

**completed work remains unverified until an explicit verification edge names it.** A
passing command nearby in time cannot establish which work it assessed. V2 regulation
therefore treats a completed work order without a `verification --verifies--> work` edge
as an obligation. This is deliberately stronger than command success and deliberately
weaker than a proof of semantic correctness; append-only verification receipts remain a
named future limit.

**high-frequency lifecycle hooks start without the analysis dependency stack.**
PostToolUse is the hottest and most fragile control boundary. Its eager import closure is
built-ins plus local lifecycle modules; parser registries enter only through the main CLI
composition root. The runtime canary copies the complete source tree into an isolated
project with no dependency installation and executes PostToolUse, so a future eager edge
to a parser package recreates the measured startup failure.

**hook telemetry loss never kills PostToolUse.** Read traces calibrate the context model,
but losing that observation is cheaper than breaking every tool call in an agent session.
The hook contains both dynamic-load and persistence failures, emits no canonical bytes,
and leaves the damaged target untouched. A real file-bearing hostile-target canary ensures
this contract exercises the write path rather than vacuously recording zero events.

**session startup injects only the exact session's current work order.** Assignment is
useful only if the receiving agent can distinguish its authority, success criteria,
dependencies, write scope, and collisions from another worker's. SessionStart reads the
work graph dynamically and emits only records whose owner session exactly matches the
host session; failure degrades to a named unavailable reading rather than breaking agent
startup.

**session startup teaches the executable swarm loop without manufacturing authority.**
Every agent gets the two inert readings that establish direction and fleet state, while
creation and handoff remain explicitly conditional on coordination authority. Only an
exactly owned live order acquires mutation examples, and those examples are selected from
its standing state and carry both the host session and predecessor token. After one write
the token expires and the hook says to inspect again; startup guidance therefore cannot
turn a stale instruction or a general orientation heading into last-writer-wins authority.

**session startup survives a damaged decision-journal path with named degradation.** The
journal carries decisions but cannot be allowed to prevent the agent that might repair it
from starting. SessionStart keeps the exact host identity in memory, emits the canonical
instructions plus a visible unavailable control, and skips the journal write when the
standing path cannot be read or opened. This is degradation, not silent adoption of an
empty history.

**harness source remains searchable text rather than silently becoming binary.** Agent
navigation depends on ordinary repository search seeing every source file. A single literal
zero byte can make common tools classify an otherwise textual module as binary and omit its
matches without a syntax or type error. Keeping control ranges escaped in source preserves
runtime meaning while making disappearance from the reading surface a loud regression.

**cached decisions expose structurally expired premises.** A decision saves inference only
while the repository addresses supporting it remain live. Broken explicit referents must
be louder than readable but stale rationale.

**predicted context closure is calibrated against observed reads and outcomes.** Economy's
one-hop closure is a hypothesis about necessary reading, not cognition. Observed reads and
later defect labels give that model a path to correction instead of turning it into dogma.

**calibration preserves the weakest host attribution of its trace.** A Codex parent
session file can contain parent and descendant tool use because PostToolUse supplies no
child id. Calibration may still compare that aggregate against a patch, but it must name
the aggregate rather than relabeling those writes as one agent's work. Legacy rows remain
unscoped, shared-worktree fallback remains separate, and any unreadable row prevents a
new sample instead of disappearing from its denominator.

**reviewed risk sites survive relocation but never duplication.** A ratchet baseline is a
cached review, and a cached fact that expires on a rename rots the same way a decision's
premises do — a refactor then spends a reviewer's attention on sites nobody touched, and
attention spent on false alarms is how a real one gets waved through. Relocation changes
where a reviewed site lives; duplication changes how much unreviewed surface exists, and
only the second is news.

**pinned mass follows a value-conserving rename but never absorbs growth.** A mass
dimension's key embeds a name someone chose — a spec H1, a measure's config key — so a
rename re-addresses the pin, and a ratchet that reads its own re-addressing as "gained
parts nobody named" prints a lie beside the unchanged total that refutes it (measured:
one H1 edit, 35 lines relabeled, zero gained, gate red). The repair must stay
count-conserving: only a vanished pin with the same family, unit and exact value can
absorb a new name, or growth and novelty would ride in under renames.

**a claim goes green only on positive evidence its oracle ran.** The verifier's whole
authority rests on this one property, and until now no claim cited it: an audit deleted
the rule and the tree stayed "✓ coherent" while the unit test failed unseen. An exit
code is the runner's statement about itself, not about the named test — a filter that
matched nothing exits clean on every runner class this repo has measured — so green
must require output that names the run, the one reading absence cannot produce.

**a vanished oracle reds its claim, never green-by-absence.** A renamed or deleted test
leaves a claim citing a name nothing owns, and that claim then guards nothing while
wearing green. Absence has to be its own observable verdict, distinct from ran-and-failed,
because the two demand different repairs: a red test needs the code fixed, a vanished
oracle needs the contract re-tied to something that exists.

**fast verification rejects a statically vanished Vitest oracle without executing
tests.** Name ownership is cheaper than test outcome: a literal Vitest declaration either
still supplies a runner-style full name or it does not. The edit loop should answer that
structural question without buying remote credentials or a suite boot, while refusing to
turn dynamic or damaged source into false certainty. Static presence therefore remains a
skip. A complete current population can prove absence; independently, a concrete Git
`HEAD` owner disappearing from a deleted or still-complete former path proves an ownership
loss even when unrelated current source is incomplete. If that same path becomes dynamic
or damaged, it stays explicitly unknown; everything else does too. The
executable tier alone can supply pass/fail evidence. This is a direct-declaration grade,
not an evaluator for arbitrary runtime registration; projects beyond it disable
`staticOracleExistence` or resolve a fresh report.

**fast oracle absence requires a complete direct-declaration population.** Absence is a
stronger statement than failure: it says the registry owns no matching name. The static
floor may say that only when every registration mechanism it recognizes was enumerable;
dynamic titles, fixture DSLs, registration-time module loads, custom includes, and damaged
source must poison absence into UNKNOWN while still allowing positive direct matches.
Otherwise the cheap tier would turn its own inability to see a live oracle into evidence
that the oracle vanished.

**committed platform capabilities survive optional deployment-config toggles.** The graph
describes the capability surface authored code can address, not only what one machine has
enabled for its next deploy. For Cloudflare stores, a direct `Env` property with a known
binding type and a wrangler stanza are two observations of the same binding domain: the
adapter unions them, collapses agreement, and refuses disagreement. Source inference uses
the graph's already-filtered file population, so a generated machine-local environment
declaration cannot become a hidden second walk. Runtime-variable names are retained as
declarations, but their deployment values are unrepresentable in `Bindings` and never
enter generated artifacts. An optional binding or machine-specific value may therefore
change without silently changing the architecture documented for the same source tree.

**a declared invariant unanchored by any boundary fails coverage.** A spec may not
assert a property that nothing enforces: that is the ratchet the whole harness turns on,
and if it silently loosened, specs would drift back into aspiration prose. The gap has to
cost a red at the run that opened it, while the person who opened it still holds the
context to close it.

**a via-test oracle that iterates no live domain fails its claim.** A totality label on a
sampling test is worse than no label: it retires the reader's suspicion without retiring
the risk. Deriving the checked set from the live registry the chokepoint actually serves
is what makes "covers every case" a fact about the system rather than about the fixture
list the author remembered.

**a skipped run never clobbers an oracle's recorded verdict.** The record is the last
known truth, honestly dated. A fast tier that skips the executable claims every commit
would otherwise erase last week's real pass — or, worse, a real fail — with "did not
look", and history that can be overwritten by not looking is not history.

**a named oracle that no test runs cannot pass.** The serial runner is the component the
executable tier leans its trust on, and it was outside the evidence perimeter — unclaimed,
untested, and (measured) willing to exit clean when the cited title survived only as a
string in a file. The runner itself must refuse a name it cannot show ran, because every
green above it inherits that refusal.

**an empty derivation against a remembered surface refuses, never passes.** Every verdict
in this file rests on the graph deriving non-empty, and nothing checked that premise:
gutting `buildGraph` left the gate printing "claims: 0" and "✓ coherent", exit 0 —
deeper than a vanished oracle, because it empties every check at once while announcing
they all passed. The record remembers how many claims the last run graded, so a run that
suddenly sees zero must refuse rather than report success over nothing; the only
legitimate zero (a project adopting from nothing) is exactly the one with no memory, and
it gets the adoption ladder instead. The floor deliberately stops at zero: a partial
collapse where every component keeps a claim is observationally identical to deliberate
pruning, and deletion has to stay free or people stop deleting. What the complement
underneath it actually reaches is narrower than it first appears — a component stripped of
its claims is still a node someone can red, while a component the walk never discovered
leaves nothing behind to notice, so an N→1 slide reads as N ordinary prunings. Pinning the
population as a mass dimension is the honest answer there, because the question it settles
is not whether anything survived but whether as much survived as last time.

**lifecycle hook presence is one canonical runnable bit.** The control surface cannot
create a field if every repository is free to carry a merely similar—or silently dead—
hook. Printing, installation, and inspection therefore share one five-event value and
one stable launcher per host. Presence means exactly one shared project copy, no competing
local, inline, or legacy path, an aligned host/launcher root, a correct declared root
mapping, an enabled project-hook layer, and a runnable target. Unrelated hooks may coexist.
Historical journal activity is reported beside this bit but can neither redeem current
absence nor erase current presence.

**supported lifecycle hosts share one control contract without sharing host syntax.**
Claude and Codex expose the same five lifecycle meanings through different settings files,
matchers, launch commands, and response envelopes. Host parity therefore means deriving
each complete bundle from one host-selected domain while retaining a distinct fingerprint;
copying Claude bytes into Codex would be resemblance, not parity.

**current-session activation requires exact installed-bundle evidence.** Structural
presence proves that the project control is runnable, not that this session loaded it. A
session becomes observed only when its activity names the selected host, launcher
transport, and current bundle fingerprint. Direct probes, stale bundles, other sessions,
and a guessed newest session cannot establish activation; parent-session fallback stays a
named attribution ceiling rather than being promoted to child evidence.

**customized hook text composes declared overrides and appends, degrading to canon on
damage.** The canonical hook text is the harness's voice — identical across adopting
projects, and byte-testable because of it — but a project knows things the harness cannot:
its own commands, its conventions, the one warning its history taught it. So a project
gets a declared voice per event rather than a fork of the hook body, under one composition
rule with no conflict state: the override answers what the base is, the append answers
what follows it, and both may coexist; an empty override is a deliberate, visible silence,
not an error. Damage must degrade to the canonical emission at hook time, because the hook
body runs inside every agent session of every adopting project — a torn customization
file that broke sessions would make the journal's carrier the thing that kills the work it
records — so a tear costs exactly the customization, never the session, and the loud
surface for it is `hooks review`, where a reader is actually looking. Events with no
canonical emission — main Stop, PostToolUse — speak only with a declared project voice;
main Stop's canonical byte-silence and the attribution reasoning behind it stand unchanged
as the default.

**python sources feed the same instruments as typescript at their declared grade.**
The adapter seam always promised language-agnosticism, but three analyzers and two
scanners parsed TypeScript directly, so a python project's surface grew invisibly — the
zero-anchor alarm never fired, parity claims skipped `.py` oracles, duplicated domains
went unranked, batch oracles knew one report format, and f-string interpolations were not
sites. Each instrument now reads python at a DECLARED grade: most through the shared
grammar queries of phase 2b (surface, sites, sinks), the oracle arms at the pinned
indent-block grade their guards froze — in-harness, no subprocess, and since the arms
ported, no compiler dependency at all. The grade is declared, not hidden —
precision is preferred over recall everywhere, because an advisory that cries wolf
retires the reader's attention without retiring risk, and with no compiler behind `.py`
a false positive can never be rescued downstream. What the regex grade deliberately does
not count is journaled beside each instrument, so the next reader inherits the boundary
of the instrument instead of rediscovering it.

**a declared language resolves to a real adapter or refuses, never a silent fallback.**
The graph is the one derivation everything downstream consumes, and the adapter decides
what that derivation can see. The old `?? typescript` fallback meant a typo'd language
name walked the wrong grammar and reported on the garbage with full confidence — the
same walking-a-different-tree failure the config loader refuses for, one seam later. So
an unknown bare name now refuses with the live built-in list, and the same seam is where
a project brings its own language: a `./`-relative module exporting the LanguageAdapter
shape, validated field-by-field so the refusal names the line that needs fixing.
Importing project code is not new trust — the atlas already declares at the loadConfig
crossing that running the harness in a tree executes that tree's config. What a custom
adapter buys is the graph tier: symbols, import edges, prose, claims over them. The
per-language instrument arms (surface counting, oracle analysis, redundancy, sinks,
batch formats) remain harness contributions, and the documentation says so, because an
adapter author who is not told the boundary believes they have the full field when they
have half.

**a grammar-backed adapter derives the graph through the same language seam.** The
regex adapters scale in expert code — the python push measured ~900 hand-built lines
across five instrument arms — while a grammar plus capture queries scales in data:
modern tree-sitter grammar packages ship a prebuilt wasm, `web-tree-sitter` runs it
without a native toolchain, and the language-specific knowledge shrinks to patterns a
contributor can write without touching verdict logic. The factory is async once (wasm
load) and the adapter it returns is synchronous, so the seam is unchanged and a project
module reaches it with one top-level await. The corpus diff that justified the phase
also bounded it: on this repository's own sixty-three TypeScript files the regex grade
missed zero symbols a real parse found, so the graph tier was not where parse fidelity
was owed. The built-ins then CONVERGED onto the grammar path anyway — not for fidelity
but because two implementations of one outcome are two spellings of a domain, the
redundancy class this harness ranks in other people's code. The regex adapters were
corpus-diffed to parity (every delta an enumerated regex mistake), their prose logic
ported verbatim, and then deleted; their grammars ship vendored with provenance. The
instrument arms remain hand-built until a later phase ports them to query packs.

**instrument arms read languages through shared grammar queries, never a parallel
scanner.** Phase 2b's contract, proven first on the injection ratchet: a language
contributes captures and signals — which node is an interpolation, how its SQL context
announces itself — and the mechanism owns classification, safe-pattern grading, site
identity, and the ratchet, once. The regex scanners this replaced matched line TEXT, so
they counted `${}` inside plain strings, comments, and test fixtures as sites, bounded
visibility at one brace of nesting, and one of them matched its own source. The query
scan re-pinned the baseline with every delta enumerated: nineteen real nested-brace
sites gained, one self-match artifact gone. A new language now gains the whole
instrument from a table row — ruby's took three lines and no scanner — which is the
two-tier boundary dissolving arm by arm.

**a built-in language pack is data: queries, patterns, and named strategies, never
code.** The declarative baseline is what keeps "add a language" a table-row act instead
of an expert contribution — and it is a rule that erodes one convenient function at a
time unless something refuses. So the packs are inspectable values aggregated in one
place, and a guard sweeps them for function-valued fields by path: the hand-rolled
scanner class is unrepresentable at the seam, not merely discouraged. The rule's edge
is honest about what a pack may name — strategies from a closed, mechanism-owned set
("jsdoc", "docstring", "cooked-string") — because some knowledge is genuinely
procedural; naming it keeps the procedure written once where every language can reach
it. Project adapter modules remain code territory by definition: purity governs what
ships built in, where a single spelling is the entire point.

**a parse's heap is returned before the next file.** web-tree-sitter trees hold wasm
heap only an explicit delete returns, and the emscripten heap is fixed — so a leak is
invisible on a small repository and fatal on a large one, the worst observability
profile a defect can have. The measured incident is the refutation above. The repair is
the ladder's top rung, not discipline: `withTree` owns the tree's whole lifetime, every
call site takes it, node captures die inside it (the one lazy consumer was made eager
rather than allowed to touch a freed node), and forgetting to free is unrepresentable.

**an undeclared root refuses the walk, never wanders.** A configless run walks whatever
directory the shell happened to be in and grades that population with full confidence —
the incident run was `npx coherence verify` from a home directory, which is not exotic;
it is the first thing a curious adopter types. The config file's PRESENCE is the
declaration, so `{}` is a complete first rung of the adoption ladder, and the refusal
prints exactly that one-line bootstrap. Journal, hook, and reference commands never
walk, so they stay available in an undeclared directory — the field does not require a
config to remember decisions.

**experiment outcomes require criterion-total evidence.** A
plan is frozen before work with its predicted context, actions, criteria, and evidence
cursors. Closure answers every action and criterion exactly once, preserves the assessor,
and derives success, failure, or inconclusive from criterion statuses rather than accepting
an outcome label. Otherwise the ledger would turn an incomplete story into a measured loop.

**experiment telemetry preserves its weakest provable attribution.** Trace and activity
windows may be empty, prove an exact owner session, or only prove a parent-session aggregate
that can include descendants; older trace may carry no observation metadata at all. Those
four scopes remain distinct in the immutable close record. Damaged prefixes, unreadable
rows, and unknown or inconsistent scope refuse. That keeps compatible history without
turning absence or uncertainty into false precision.

**activity evidence is accepted only when identity, scope, time, and command agree.** A
row is useful precisely because later status and experiment readers stop re-deriving the
host event. That cached inference is safe only while its relational fields still agree:
agent attribution names the row session, parent fallback names its parent domain, event
identity recomputes, time is canonical, and command kind/result agrees with name and exit
code. One strict reader grades that whole relation; malformed rows become counted damage,
never partially trusted evidence.

**surviving agent-assessed defect evidence is attributable and internally consistent.** A
conjecture keeps uncertainty alive; a defect record says an agent crossed that epistemic
boundary and must therefore carry the evidence for doing so, the repository subject it
judged, and the caller-attributed writer labels attached to the assessment. Records append per session and
dedupe exact retries, while the merged reader recomputes the ordinary content address and
refuses malformed, inconsistent, or displaced surviving rows. That detects partial damage;
it does not prove that a valid row was never rewritten with a recomputed id. Committed Git
history is this first recorder's external rewrite and deletion witness, and an independently
anchored head is future work.

**defect writes refuse pre-existing symlink redirection.** A path beneath the repository
is not containment when its stable components redirect through a symlink. The reader
therefore refuses linked ledger directories and entries, while the writer validates both
directory components and opens the session target without following its final link, then
compares the opened descriptor with the standing path before appending. This prevents the
measured stable-state redirects; it is not an `openat`-grade promise against a privileged
process racing parent-directory renames during the append.

**defect provenance is data, never terminal control.** Repository identity is captured by
the machine, but the committed row is still untrusted input on its next read. A commit is
therefore null or has lowercase SHA-1/SHA-256 object-name shape, never merely a nonempty string; the
human renderer also neutralizes its bytes. Without both the semantic constraint and the
output encoding, an edited but re-addressed row could turn provenance into a terminal
instruction while remaining structurally valid.

**a streamed journal entry renders exactly once across appends and compaction.** The live
stream exists for the one reader the settled render cannot serve — an orchestrator watching
five subagents mid-flight — and that reader has no way to audit the feed against the files.
A dropped entry is a decision the orchestrator never saw, indistinguishable from one never
made; a duplicate teaches the opposite lie, that a question was decided twice. Both are
cheap to produce, because the journal's files do not strictly grow: compaction moves lines
between files and unlinks the originals, which a position-addressed reader replays in full.
So a record's identity in the stream comes from its content — the same triple the merged
timeline sorts by — and a moved line is one the feed already carried.

(The import claims above separately prove that the composition root still reaches the
configuration loader, graph derivation, verifier, spec walker, and journal.)
