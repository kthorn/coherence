// due.ts — WHICH INSTRUMENTS THE TREE HAS OUTRUN, counted in commits.
//
// ── THE FINDING ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `.coherence/status.json` stamps every section with the commit that produced it, and
// nothing ever reads those stamps back to ask whether they are still current. Measured
// across two projects the day this was written:
//
//     coherence   verify 1 · atlas 2 · mass 2 · economy 45 · drift 45
//     hoist       verify 1 · atlas 1 · mass 11 · economy 28   (full tier: 9)
//
// Five sections on two repos, four of them tens of commits behind a tree that moved every
// day. Nobody was ignoring the tool; nobody was being told.
//
// ── COMMITS, NOT CLOCK, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE MEASUREMENT ────────────────────────────
//
// A repo nobody touched is neglecting nothing. `economy` last run three weeks ago is
// perfect health on a frozen tree and an emergency on this one, and wall-clock cannot
// tell those apart — it reports the same "3 weeks" for both. NEGLECT IS THE TREE MOVING
// WHILE THE INSTRUMENT DID NOT, so the unit is commits landed since the recorded run, and
// a quiet week is silent by construction rather than by a special case.
//
// ── WHY THIS STAYS A MAINTENANCE QUEUE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// SessionStart is the one channel agents reliably notice, so stale instruments remain
// visible there. It must not, however, commandeer an unrelated task or compel a journal
// entry merely for deferral. The emitted text points to a dedicated maintenance or
// branch-finalization session while remaining silent when nothing is due.
//
// ── IT NEVER WRITES AND IT NEVER GATES ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every function here reads the run record and `git rev-list --count`. Nothing records
// that the advisory was shown. A SessionStart hook that mutated the repository merely by
// starting a session would be worse than a missed reminder, so `runHook` always returns 0.

/**
 * HOW MANY COMMITS BEFORE A RECORDED RUN STOPS BEING CURRENT.
 *
 * There is no measurement that fixes this number, so it is chosen against the failure
 * mode rather than against the data. Both dogfood repos commit 8–39 times on an active
 * day, so ten is roughly half a working day of motion — long enough that the tree has
 * genuinely changed underneath the verdict, short enough to still be this session's
 * problem. The observed split sat at 1·1·2·2 (current) against 9·11·28·45·45 (stale),
 * so ten lands inside the gap rather than through a cluster.
 *
 * Erring HIGH is the safe direction: a threshold too low prints on every session, and a
 * section of this block that always prints costs the other three their attention.
