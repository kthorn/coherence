// test-batch.ts — BATCHED ORACLE EXECUTION. Run the consuming project's test runner
// ONCE, with a machine-readable reporter, and resolve every executable claim from that
// single report instead of booting the runner per claim.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The per-claim arm (`execNamedTest` in phrasebook.ts) shells
// `config.test` + the claim name once per executable claim. It needs no reporter, no
// schema, and no trust in a report file — which is why it survives as the explicit
// escape hatch — but the cost is a whole runner boot per claim, and on a project whose
// pool is expensive to start (a workerd/vitest pool: 15-30s) it is pure redundancy —
// measured at 20-35 minutes for ~70 executable claims in a suite that runs end-to-end
// in under two. One boot, then N lookups, is the same evidence for one two-hundredth
// of the wall clock; as of v0.17.0 the serial profile runs only when NAMED
// (--serial-oracles), never as a default.
//
// THE GUARANTEE IS THE POINT, NOT THE SPEED. This module is only allowed to exist
// because it can reproduce the per-claim path's verdicts exactly, including the one
// that took a regression to learn (`config.testMatch`): a claim whose test was renamed
// or deleted must go RED, never green-by-absence. Here that protection is structural
// rather than configured — zero matching tests in the report is a red with a reason,
// and there is no exit code to misread.

 * measured, the unescaped form matched ZERO tests and exited 0).
 *
 * THREE STATES, AND THE THIRD IS THE POINT. A report distinguishes what an exit code
 * cannot:
 *   (a) the named test RAN and PASSED   → green
 *   (b) the named test RAN and FAILED   → red, naming the failing test
 *   (c) the named test DOES NOT EXIST   → red, and said so as its own distinct verdict
 * State (c) is the defect the per-claim path collapses into (a): `vitest -t` exits 0 when
 * the filter matched nothing, so a renamed or deleted oracle reads as a pass unless the
 * project hand-configured `config.testMatch` to demand "N passed" in the output. That is a
 * hole plugged by a config knob the project has to know to set. Here it is closed
 * STRUCTURALLY — there is no exit code to misread, absence is directly observable, and
 * `testMatch` has nothing left to do for a batched claim. Same move as a typo'd claim verb
 * or an unknown claim kind: eliminate the failure mode rather than paper over it.
 *
 * GREEN REQUIRES POSITIVE EVIDENCE: at least one matching test that actually PASSED, and
 * none that failed.
 *
 * ATTRIBUTION IS PER CLAIM. This resolves ONE claim's oracle and returns ONE claim's
 * detail, naming that oracle and the specific test that failed. A batch verdict of "the
 * suite is red" would be a regression on the per-claim path, so no caller aggregates:
 * the batch is shared EVIDENCE, never a shared verdict.
 *
 * `ms` — THE HOLDING COST OF THIS CLAIM: the summed runner-reported duration of every test
 * the claim's name matched, because a claim that matches three tests is buying all three.
 * It is present ONLY when at least one match actually carried a duration; a report with no
 * timings answers "unknown", not "free". The sum spans matches whatever their status, since
 * a failing or skipped match still consumed (or deliberately did not consume) suite time,
 * and the cost report is about the suite, not about the verdict.
