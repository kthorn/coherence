// hooks.ts — how the decision journal actually gets written.
//
// A CLI nobody invokes is worth nothing, and an agent mid-way through a 400k-token
// job will not remember a convention it read once. So the instruction is INJECTED at
// the moment each agent starts, by a `SubagentStart` hook, and the journal's state is
// read back at `SubagentStop`.
//
// WHY A CLI AND NOT AN MCP SERVER. An MCP tool's schema is loaded into the context of
// every agent that might call it — five agents, five copies, paid on every turn
// whether or not a decision gets made. A shell line costs nothing until it runs, has
// no server lifecycle to fail, and works from any agent that can run Bash. The
// journal's whole premise is that context is the scarce resource; a mechanism that
// spends context to save context is self-defeating.
//
// THE NUDGE DOES NOT FAIL THE STOP. `SubagentStop` returns non-error feedback once, then
// stays silent when the host marks the follow-up stop as active. Main-agent `Stop` is a
// different surface: the user already saw its report, and a shared worktree cannot prove
// which agent owns an unsettled patch. It records calibration with byte-empty stdout.
// Exit 2 would make the journal a gate, and a gate acquires an incentive to be complete —
// at which point it is a transcript again, which is the thing it compresses.

SubagentStart / SessionStart inject the instruction below into the agent's context.
PostToolUse records explicit file reads and writes for per-agent economy calibration; it
emits no instruction and uses a dedicated dependency-light entrypoint.
SubagentStop reports what the journal holds AND the current patch's change signal, then
stays silent when the host marks the follow-up stop active. Main-agent Stop records the
calibration sample with byte-empty stdout: a shared-worktree reading cannot prove that an
obligation belongs to the agent that just stopped. It never repeats a report the user
already saw. Neither event fails a stop, because a journal that can fail a build acquires
an incentive to be complete, and a complete journal is a transcript again.

The journal lives in .coherence/decisions/ — ONE APPEND-ONLY FILE PER AGENT SESSION,
so two branches merge without a conflict and writers can never interleave. Commit the
folder; it is the record, not a cache. Read the merged timeline across every session,
job and branch with \`coherence decisions [--job X] [--agent Y] [--branch B] [--sessions] [--md]\`.
\`coherence decisions --open\` narrows it to the OPEN CONJECTURES — the standing list of
things this project noticed and did not chase, which is the entry most likely to decay
because the agent that saw it is gone.

A project may put its own voice into these emissions — \`.coherence/hooks/<Event>.override.md\`
replaces an event's canonical text, \`<Event>.append.md\` follows it — and \`coherence hooks
review\` prints every event's effective emission with its provenance.
