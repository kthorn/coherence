/**
 * THE PROJECT'S CONFIG over the defaults — and a REFUSAL when a config is there and
 * cannot be read (floor.ts's `readJsonOrRefuse`). ABSENT is legitimate and stays exactly
 * as it was: every field has a default, and running with none of them overridden is the
 * first rung of the adoption ladder.
 *
 * UNPARSEABLE never was. It used to degrade to the DEFAULTS silently, which is not a
 * milder version of the same thing — it is a harness reading a different tree than the
 * one it was configured to read, and reporting on it with full confidence. `ignore`,
 * `codeExt` and `sources` all revert, so the walk changes shape; and `name` reverts to
 * absent, which resurrects the cross-checkout `docs --check` false positive b32965d
 * shipped to kill. Every downstream refusal on this page is then computed over the
 * wrong population.
