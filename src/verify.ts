// ── the three advisories, as QUESTIONS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each of these already forms a suspicion and then discards it by printing it. `raise.ts`
// holds the mechanism and the identity doctrine; what lives here is the domain half — what
// the finding IS, what could account for it, and the test that would settle it. Written as
// free functions rather than inline so they are testable without running a whole verify.
//
// IDENTITY IS THE CLAIM (or the invariant) AND THE NODE THAT DECLARES IT. Everything else
// the advisory prints is excluded, and the run count is the excluded field that matters:
// "green for 14 runs" changes every run by construction, and it is the most tempting one
// to include because it is what makes the finding feel urgent. It goes in the SENTENCE,
// where volatility is free.

/** A claim that is green every run and that nobody has ever watched fail. Neither signal
 *  is worth much alone — a claim that has never been red may simply be a good invariant,
 *  and one with no refutation may simply be young — but together they are the honest
 *  suspect list, which is exactly the shape of a conjecture. */
/** How much a missing refutation should WORRY you, by the shape of the claim's evidence.
 *
 *  MEASURED, NOT REASONED. The first real `verify --raise` ever run against hoist spent its
 *  three-question budget like this: one genuinely valuable question (the `served responses
 *  are shaped` boundary, never watched fail), one marginal, and one on
 *  `README.md exists at root — 146 run(s), never observed failing`. The list was emitted in
 *  DERIVATION order, so the cap — which exists precisely because attention is the scarce
 *  resource — was spent on the least informative finding in an 81-item list.
 *
 *  THE RANKING IS BY WHETHER A REFUTATION WOULD TEACH ANYTHING, and the three tiers fall
 *  out of what the claim's evidence actually is:
 *
 *    ORACLE-BACKED (`via test`, `via guard`, `passes test`, `conforms to`) ranks highest,
 *    because this is where VACUOUS GREEN lives. An oracle can stop testing what it names
 *    and nothing says so — this project has found that exact defect repeatedly, including
 *    one oracle satisfied by a different error thrown earlier than the one under test, and
 *    a `.rejects.toThrow()` passing on a why-gate rather than the seal it claimed to guard.
 *    An unrefuted oracle is a claim whose instrument has never been checked.
 *
 *    BOUNDARY-ONLY (a crossing with no executable oracle) ranks next: it names a real
 *    chokepoint, so the property matters, but the evidence is anchoring rather than
 *    execution and its failure mode is narrower.
 *
 *    STRUCTURAL (`X exists at …`, `X imports …`) ranks LAST, and this is the tier the
 *    incident was about. Such a claim can be broken — delete the file — but doing so
 *    demonstrates nothing except that `stat` works. Its greenness was never in doubt and a
 *    refutation would be theatre. Note the run count argues the same way and is deliberately
 *    NOT used: 146 runs green says the claim is stable, not that it is informative, and
 *    ranking on it would put the oldest trivia first.
 *
 *  This orders the printed list too, not just the raise queue — the reader of a capped list
 *  deserves the same triage as the queue that spends the budget. */
