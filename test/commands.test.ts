// commands.test.ts — THE TOTALITY ORACLE for the command registry.
//
// The command list used to be spelled in three places and enforced in none: the usage
// banner, the `cmd === "…"` dispatch chain, and README.md's `## Commands`. In two days it
// drifted three times (a merge conflict on the banner literal, banner 29 vs dispatch 30,
// README 20 vs dispatch 32). `coherence redundancy` reported the banner/dispatch pair every
// single run — "identical today, tied together by nothing" — and was right every time.
//
// Two of the three spellings are now DERIVED from src/commands.ts, so they cannot drift.
// The dispatch is still hand-written, which is what this file is for. It ENUMERATES THE
// LIVE DISPATCH — every `cmd === "<literal>"` in src/cli.ts, read out of the TypeScript
// AST, not out of a list maintained here — and asserts set equality with the registry. A
// hand-written expected list would be a FOURTH spelling of the domain and would drift like
// the other three; the point of a totality oracle is that it reads the world.
//
// The AST is used rather than a regex on purpose: a regex would also match `cmd === "x"`
// inside a comment or a string, and an oracle that can be fooled by a code comment is not
// one. Comments are not in the AST at all.

// The question these two oracles settle was left OPEN in the journal when `writesArtifacts`
// landed, in the comment above: "whether a broken deriver should also be barred from
// zeroing a baseline is a real and separate question". It is answered, by measurement: a
// gutted `buildGraph` made `mass --check` print "✓ mass ratchet held" over a reading that
// had collapsed to nothing, then prescribe the re-pin that banks it, and the resulting
// baseline of zeroes INVERTED once derivation was restored — the project's own untouched
// mass then read as GROWTH. So the flag exists, and it is load-bearing in both directions:
// declared → the refusal is DEMANDED of it here; observed → it must be declared.
