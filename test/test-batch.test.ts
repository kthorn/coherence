// test-batch.test.ts — BATCHED ORACLE EXECUTION. Two halves: the pure report layer
// (parse + match) driven directly, and the whole feature driven end-to-end through
// runVerify against a fake batch runner.
//
// THE FIXTURE IS REAL. `VITEST_REPORT` below was captured from an actual
// `npx vitest run --reporter=json --outputFile=…` on vitest 4.1.10 (stack traces pared
// down, timings dropped; every field name, nesting level, and `fullName` value is
// verbatim). The schema was not guessed — the whole feature rests on `fullName` being
// the runner's own suite-path concatenation and on `-t` matching it unanchored, and both
// were verified by running the real thing before any of this was written.
//
// Note the fixture contains "write policy totality covers every op" AND
// "write policy totality covers every op extended" — the prefix edge, where a claim name
// that is a strict prefix of a longer test's name must match BOTH, because that is what
// the runner's `-t` does.
