# Coherence

The repository-level reading surface: configuration, package contract, generated maps,
and the authored explanation of why the harness exists.

Implementation belongs to the nested source and test components. This root component
keeps only the files that establish how those components are built, read, and released.

## works when

- coherence.config.json exists at root
- passes test "control — this repository's own lifecycle control is PRESENT"
- passes test "repository voice — contributor startup keeps public capability changes tied to the global hook contract"

## why

An agent should encounter the project's purpose and its ownership seams before source
detail. The project hook wiring also records which repository reads informed a change and
which decisions survived it. Keeping coordination separate from implementation makes that
first read small while still checking that every deeper entry point is reachable.

This spec once claimed five obvious files existed at root; three were pruned rather than
dressed up, because a root claim earns its line only when the failure it detects would
otherwise be SILENT. `package.json`, `README.md`, and `src/cli.ts` fail loudly on their
own — npm, the reader, and the CLI itself all scream within seconds of their absence —
so claiming them was green weight that could never turn red for an interesting reason
(the Known-limits section calls that spec "coherent and worthless"). The two claims
kept from that pruning are the ones whose absence the system absorbs without a sound:
`loadConfig`
falls back to defaults when `coherence.config.json` is missing (verify would silently
run with no test runner, no serial pin, and the wrong testMatch), and a missing lifecycle
control kills the journal hooks with no host error at all. The latter used to be the weak
structural claim `.claude/settings.json exists at root`; now the root claims the binary
control reading itself for every host this repository supports. Its oracle checks each
host's complete tracked control—settings, native package or stable launcher, and root
mapping—their exact composition, host-specific exclusion controls, the absence of a
competing path, and the runnable target. One meaningful claim is lighter and stronger than six
green file-existence claims. Fewer claims, honestly scoped, is still the trade this
harness teaches; making its own root spec take it is the least it owes.

The repository-specific SessionStart appendix is a third silent surface: if it vanishes,
the canonical consumer hook correctly falls back and no host reports an error, but a
contributor can add an agent-facing capability without reviewing the global startup
contract, protocol identity, host controls, or docs. Its claim therefore exercises the
real composition crossing and pins the maintenance trigger's named surfaces while proving
that the reminder stays out of consumer canon. This is project policy carried by the
project voice, not maintenance detail imposed on every adopter.

## Installation contract

Consumer Git installation builds the TypeScript CLI without requiring native C/C++
grammar compilation. The runtime and adapter tests use committed WASM; native grammar
packages are not normal install dependencies. The chokepoint is package dependency
selection before npm's Git `prepare`. CI's `node scripts/package-smoke.mjs --git`
exercises a fresh Git consumer with source builds forced and compiler commands disabled.
This is an explicit CI oracle rather than a serial `verify` claim that would repeat a
network installation for each verification. The grammar refresh command alone downloads
exact pinned npm tarballs with lifecycle scripts disabled and extracts prebuilt WASM.

## Seams

- Git source → npm preparation → installed CLI: `package.json` build dependencies supply
  the compiler-free consumer smoke; a package tarball is not an adequate substitute for
  this crossing because Git preparation installs development dependencies too.
- npm grammar tarballs → committed `grammars/`: the explicit refresh script owns exact
  source versions; byte-identical refresh checks and real adapter tests validate the
  shipped WASM without installing native Node bindings.
